# Accelerating Machine Learning
Welcome to the "Accelerating Machine Learning" course at AIMS 2025. This repository will store all of the course contents, and provide information on how to access the relevant notebooks.

The course requires access to OneAPIs FPGA codebase. To avoid a lengthy (and memory-intensive) installation process, we have set up a Docker container with the relevant libraries on a Google Cloud Virtual Machine (VM). This VM will only stay active for a few days after the course due to running costs. The Google Colab link below provides a portal to the course notebook within the Docker container. You will need to input the VM IP address, port and jupyter token, that will be provided by the course leader.
